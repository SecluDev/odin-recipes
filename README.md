This fun mini project required me to create 4 pages and link them together. 1 webpage acting as a home page and 3 others with their own recipe instructions. I even went out of the way to add pngs for all the steps of each recipe page.
I've gained confidence in creating webpages from scratch and typing up the boilerplates, linking local images, the common elements learned (<ul> <ol> <li> <strong> <em> <p> <h1-6> ).This project has also given me time to reference
the git commands for my repository as well as bash commands for moving/renaming/creating files and making/navigating the different directories. Overall a lot more confident with html, can't wait to look back at these projects.
